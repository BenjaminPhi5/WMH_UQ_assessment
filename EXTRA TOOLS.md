put here instructions on how to install fsl

put here instructions on synth seg in more detail:

but mainly, follow the instructions on https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSeg
install it to the home folder
then install numpy==1.23.5 since the conda thing installs numpy vs 1.24 which breaks the tensorflow thing.
Currently still trying to get it working with the gpu but this is a start and gives great ventricle segmentations. Nice.
