lets just try using a deep learning model now. I can take a resnet 18, and train it to predicit fazekas. I will need predicted uncertainty maps for each technique,
along with the training data. Use a 0.15 validation and test split. see if I can get a better prediction. I will include the information that I have, and try to tune the model.
I can give the model:

just the clinical score data:, then a model with the mean segmentation and flair, and then mean seg and uncertainty and flair, and see how it goes. See if we get a significant improvement. That
would be great. Nice. Okay, time for lunch, and then I can set this up. Good!
If I have a 2.5D model it can have 3 slices picked per patient, as a predictor. need to pick those three slices carefully though.... I will have a very small dataset to train my model with
so maybe I should have a very small model... I can't train on patches to do deep, so this might be quite involved actually... hmm... use my standard augmentation pipeline, and
pick three random slices from within the centre of the brain roughly.
